# azs-border-distance
Python pipeline to compute geodesic distance from each fuel station (AZS) to the nearest international border for border-proximity analytics. Uses GeoPandas/Shapely, builds a robust border line from GADM L0 polygons, and outputs azsCode + DistanceToBoarder CSV. Includes CLI, examples, and BI-ready metrics.
